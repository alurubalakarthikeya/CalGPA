        <h1>Grading Systems</h1> <br>
        <p>There are two types of grading systems commonly used in educational institutions: Relative Grading and Absolute Grading.</p> <br>
        <h1>Relative Grading</h1>
        <p>Relative grading, also known as curve grading, assigns grades based on the distribution of scores within a class. This means that a student's grade is determined in relation to the performance of their peers. For example, the top 10% of students might receive an 'O', the next 20% a 'A', and so on. This system ensures a certain percentage of students receive each grade, regardless of their absolute performance.</p> <br>
        <div class="table">
            <div class="box-one">
            <h3><strong>Advantages of Relative Grading:</strong></h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourages competition among students.</li>
                <li>Accounts for varying levels of difficulty in different exams.</li>
                <li>Ensures a balanced distribution of grades.</li> <br>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="box-two">
            <h3><strong>Disadvantages of Relative Grading:</strong></h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Can create unhealthy competition among students.</li>
                <li>May not accurately reflect a student's understanding of the material.</li>
                <li>Students' grades depend on the performance of their peers.</li>
            </ul> 
        </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h1>Absolute Grading</h1>
        <p>Absolute grading assigns grades based on a fixed scale, where each grade corresponds to a specific range of scores. For example, a score of 90-100 will be an 'O', 80-89 a 'A', and so on. This system evaluates students based on their individual performance, without considering how others have performed.</p> <br>
        <h3><strong>Advantages of Absolute Grading:</strong></h3> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Provides a clear and consistent standard for all students.</li>
            <li>Encourages mastery of the material.</li>
            <li>Grades are not influenced by the performance of peers.</li> <br>
        </ul>
        <h3><strong>Disadvantages of Absolute Grading:</strong></h3> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not account for varying levels of difficulty in different exams.</li>
            <li>May not provide a balanced distribution of grades.</li>
            <li>Can be discouraging if the grading scale is too strict.</li>
        </ul> 
        <!--<h3>Types of Grading Systems:</h3>
            <p>1) Relative Grading</p>
            <p>2) Standard Grading</p><br>
        <p><strong>Relative Grading: </strong>     This grading system assigns a grade to each subject based on a scale of 0 to 100. The grades are then converted into a weighted average, which is then used to calculate the overall SGPA. Relative grading can help students understand the importance of each subject and make informed decisions about their academic plans.</p>
        <p><strong>Standard Grading: </strong>     This grading system assigns a grade to each subject based on predefined criteria, such as A, B, C, D, and F. The grades are then converted into a weighted average, which is then used to calculate the overall SGPA. Standard grading can help students understand the importance of each subject and make informed decisions about their academic plans.</p><br>
