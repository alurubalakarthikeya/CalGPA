                <h1>Grading Systems</h1> <br>
                <p>There are two types of grading systems commonly used in educational institutions: Relative Grading and Absolute Grading. Grading systems are essential for evaluating student performance and ensuring a standardized assessment process. </p> <br>

        <h1>Relative Grading</h1>
        <p>Relative grading, also known as curve grading, assigns grades based on the distribution of scores within a class. This means that a student's grade is determined in relation to the performance of their peers. For example, the top 10% of students might receive an 'O', the next 20% a 'A', and so on. This system ensures a certain percentage of students receive each grade, regardless of their absolute performance.</p> <br>

        <h1>Absolute Grading</h1>
        <p>Absolute grading assigns grades based on a fixed scale, where each grade corresponds to a specific range of scores. For example, a score of 90-100 will be an 'O', 80-89 a 'A', and so on. This system evaluates students based on their individual performance, without considering how others have performed.</p> <br>

        <!--<h3>Types of Grading Systems:</h3>
            <p>1) Relative Grading</p>
            <p>2) Standard Grading</p><br>
        <p><strong>Relative Grading: </strong>     This grading system assigns a grade to each subject based on a scale of 0 to 100. The grades are then converted into a weighted average, which is then used to calculate the overall SGPA. Relative grading can help students understand the importance of each subject and make informed decisions about their academic plans.</p>
        <p><strong>Standard Grading: </strong>     This grading system assigns a grade to each subject based on predefined criteria, such as A, B, C, D, and F. The grades are then converted into a weighted average, which is then used to calculate the overall SGPA. Standard grading can help students understand the importance of each subject and make informed decisions about their academic plans.</p><br>
